\title{Summary Statistics}
\usage{
sum_stats(dataset, given_var, n_stats = 1, n_quantiles = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame. Factors and logicals will be removed.}

\item{given_var}{A variable from your \code{dataset} which you want to set as a condition.}

\item{n_stats}{Number of summary statistics you want to print.}

\item{n_quantiles}{Number of quantiles you want to partition \code{given_var}
into, with a maximum of 10.}
}
\value{
A list with one entry for each summary statistic.
}
\description{
Calculates the conditional mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis for continuous variables
based on a range of quantiles of a given continuous variable.
}
\details{
The function will return a list with one entry for each summary statistic. The 
list entries themselves are matrices. Per default, only conditional means will
be displayed. The order of the other statistics is as follows: conditional variance,
conditional skewness and conditional kurtosis, which will be displayed by choosing
n_stats to be 2, 3 or 4.
}
\examples{
data(iris)
iris <- iris[, -5]
sum_stats(iris, "Sepal.Length", n_stats = 4, n_quantiles = 5)
}
